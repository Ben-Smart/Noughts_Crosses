#Matlab Noughts and Crosses. 

Run the file `Noughts_crosses_just_play`. Enter in the row and then the column that you would like to play. 

It is automatically set up for the computer to have the first turn using dictionary Policy_P1. If you would like to go first, change `player1_computer` to false and `player2_computer` to true (this will then use the dictionary Policy_P2).
